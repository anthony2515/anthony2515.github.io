    <p>What surprised me the most about learning core is to manage your work and life balance. 
      I learned this because when you are learning to code you need to manage your time by using 
      the promodorro technique and this is also applicable when you are working in the tech industry.
       If you know how to manage your time you also have time with your whanau and your well being as well. My time is up thank you!!
