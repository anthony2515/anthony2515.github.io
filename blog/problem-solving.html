  <h1>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h1>

<h1>1. were blocked on a simple problem:</h1>

<h2>what was the problem?</h2>
<p>
   I was having a problem how to solve the stretch in the javascript-cafe were you need to code along with joseph
</p>
<h2>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h2>
<p>
  since I didnt know what I just did by coding along with the video, I went to discord and asked for help but it didnt really help me on solving the problem because
  I have a different point of view on how to solve it so what i just did is I used a rubber ducky technique to talk to the duck what should I do, and keep applying those thoughts into code
  and eventually I have solved it
</p>
<h2>how did you feel throughout the process?</h2>
<p>
  it was very challenging
</p>
<h2>what did you learn?</h2>
<p>
  I learned about understanding the code structure made by someone else before adding the feature because if you dont understand the structure of the code
  everything will be a mess
</p>
<h1>2. elegantly solved a problem.</h1>

<h2>what was the problem?</h2>
<p>making my code correct on the javascipt kata</p>
<h2>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h2>
<p>I used console logging</p>
<p>Made a pseudo code</p>
<p>Search the Internet</p>
<p>Read the error messages</p>
<h2>how did you feel throughout the process?</h2>
<p>
  I feel desperate to solve all the problems because I know I will learn something new and it also make my brain to solve the very small details of the problem
</p>
<h2>what did you learn?</h2>
<p>
  I have learned how to use the map(),filter(),find(),split(),join(),slice() although I already studied this before since I forgot anything I will always remembers those methods
  since this is the most common used methods on solving real world problems
</p>
<h1>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h1>
<ul class = "list">
<li>Pseudocode</li>
<p>-if I can visualize what code should be implemented on the problem I use this technique to remind me what are the steps needs to be done before coding</p>
<li>Trying something</li>
<p>-If ever I couldnt solve the problem Im always trying some other ways how to solve it</p>
<li>Rubber ducky method</li>
<p>
  Ill better use this method if its really hard for me to explain the context of my problem before asking question 
</p>
<li>Reading error messages</li>
<p>
  Errors are really good because this reminds me if I forgot to define the variable correctly
</p>
<li>Console.logging</li>
<p>
  I always use console logging to see whats going on on my code
</p>
<li>Googling</li>
<p>
  Googling helps me a lot specially if I dont know what code should I use, what does the error messages mean, and If I forgot how the method works I just search it on the internet
</p>
<li>Asking your peers for help</li>
<p>
  I only ask my peers if I couldnt find any solutions to my problem
</p>
<li>Asking coaches for help</li>
<p>
  I might ask question for my coach if things are really get hard and some private questions that Im not comfortable asking in public
</p>
<li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
<p>
  those challenges in this sprint improves my process of reflection because I realize how important those skilss to have
</p>
</ul>
<h1>4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h1>
<p>
  So far I never felt reluctant to ask for help, because I have all the techniques on solving the problem but if those technique couldnt solve it, I just ask for help as my last option
