  <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMindfulness ables you to reduce your stress, anger, anxiety or any issues you are facing.
    Having this ability can improve your life specially when your in a very tight situation where problems are getting on you,
    you will be able to manage it by noticing whats the situation and paying attention to your feeling like "Why am I stress, angry, anxious" 
    and think of a solution how to get rid of those emotions. In my own perspective, having this ability is all about observing the environment like 
    the place around you, observing why this person is doing such things and observing yourself too. I think an Introvert person is highly the ones who got a good emotional intelligence
    because they dont really get attached to people easily and they always take control of their emotions and understand what people feel and how they react. 
    Sometimes having a really good emotional intelligence can be bad
    base on my experience because you might abuse it by manipulating peoples mind/emotion using reverse psychology. 
    <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf im gonna get asked what is more effective between IQ and EQ,
    I choose EQ because you have an ability to notice whats going on and able to know how to get along with people to collaborate and share your solution get feedback and accept your mistakes. 
    High IQ is good as well but in my opinion, it only shows the rating on how your thinking,reasoning and remembering skills. Unlike having a good EQ shows how well you are organizing things
    interacting with other people specially on a team. So basically, lets say you are really smart on programming but you dont wanna accept any opinions from others that is better than your solution
    and those opinion will help to improve the project but you are sticking to what you believe because you think your smarter than everyone else. The person with good emotional intelligence
    is able to accept feedbacks on the others whether its good or bad. And I think that is what most company is looking for, they dont care about your programming skills but it is a bonus to them, 
    the most important keys that they looking for is your soft skills because Web development is more on collaboration with your team. Having a good team coordination will help your project improve rather than
    hiring a very skilled programmer but doesnt know how to team up and always wants hes ideas are the only solution.
