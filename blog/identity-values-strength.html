So right now I think that decision that I made will gonna change my life because this is the thing that I really wanted to do to have my time to learn more in web development and apply those knowledge at work.

And it was also influenced by my past relationships that improves my knowledge how to overcome things, deal with problems. With those experiences I learned that everything will be ok as long as you know how to manage your problems. And always be happy on your life by doing meaningful things to you.
