    <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
    <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>My longterm goal whenever I leave Dev Academy, is to become a full stack web developer as I should have learned everything in frontend as well in the backend using the tech stack
      that dev academy will teach us on the bootcamp and I think whenever we learned this stack we are capable of learning beyond what we have learned in Dev academy like learning other languages,
      frameworks and other databases.
    </p>
    <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>My biggest strength is I understand most of the concept in css,html and javascript my biggest limitation is I cannot manage my timebox if ever there is a very complicated problem.
      So in order for me to overcome this limitation I will ask someone who can solve this problem
    </p>
    <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>I would like to develop my teamwork with groups as I dont have experience to work and collaborate in a team of programmers </p>
    <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
    <p>I expect their friendly and approachable in terms of giving answers to our question and can help us to land a job</p>
    <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>I can see myself that I would be asking a lot of questions related to the lessons that the bootcamp would teach us as Im not familiar to the technology that we will learn yet
      like typescript, node js and everything.And I will do my best to share my knowledge and get feedback with my cohorts and collaborate in team effectively.
       And Im very committed to overcome this challenges because I really want to become a professional programmer one day after this bootcamp.

    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>-I want to be a full stack developer one day. </p>
    
    <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
      <p>-my strength when it comes to learning is I always take my time to understand the concept of a certain things in programming. I never jump on the other things while i havent completely understand the current concept that im learning.</p>
      <p>-My limitation when it comes to learning is when I felt stressed, I just do other stuffs or take a rest, close my eyes until my brain is ready to absorb 
      new information again. Getting a good sleep is really important for me to stay focus and understand things easily</p>
      
      
      <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p>-I really want to develop my Front-end skills as Im not really good on designing a GUI.</p>
      <p>-I want to be a colaborative member of a team.</p>
      <p>-I wanna learn to communicate effectively so everbody will understand what im trying to point out on a very complicated projects</p>
      
      <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
      
      <h3>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
      <p>-I manage myself to work productively by helping my cohorts to answer their question as I can and correct me if my opinion is wrong to improve my collaboration skills.</p>
      <p>-Ask my facilitators sensible questions related to the things that i dont understand</p>
      <p>-Follow the process one at a time.</p>
      <p>-I wanna develop many project and develop my collaboration skills to show the industry representative and get hired</p>
      
      <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>
      <p>-When this thing happened to me i just keep away from the screen for a short while, have a smoke, think deep what kind of issue should I work on to solve big problems and talk to my cohorts and facilitator to
      ask their opinions or recommendations </p>
      
      <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
      <p>-Whenever I feel stuck on some concepts or didnt understand something I will always gonna seek help with our facilitator</p>
      
      
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>-Facilitators are very approachable and can answer every questions that you ask related to programming and things in Dev Academy.</p>
      
      <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
