    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>-I want to be a full stack developer one day. </p>
    
    <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
      <p>-my strength when it comes to learning is I always take my time to understand the concept of a certain things in programming. I never jump on the other things while i havent completely understand the current concept that im learning.</p>
      <p>-My limitation when it comes to learning is when I felt stressed, I just do other stuffs or take a rest, close my eyes until my brain is ready to absorb 
      new information again. Getting a good sleep is really important for me to stay focus and understand things easily</p>
      
      
      <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p>-I really want to develop my Front-end skills as Im not really good on designing a GUI.</p>
      <p>-I want to be a colaborative member of a team.</p>
      <p>-I wanna learn to communicate effectively so everbody will understand what im trying to point out on a very complicated projects</p>
      
      <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
      
      <h3>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
      <p>-I manage myself to work productively by helping my cohorts to answer their question as I can and correct me if my opinion is wrong to improve my collaboration skills.</p>
      <p>-Ask my facilitators sensible questions related to the things that i dont understand</p>
      <p>-Follow the process one at a time.</p>
      <p>-I wanna develop many project and develop my collaboration skills to show the industry representative and get hired</p>
      
      <h3>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>
      <p>-When this thing happened to me i just keep away from the screen for a short while, have a smoke, think deep what kind of issue should I work on to solve big problems and talk to my cohorts and facilitator to
      ask their opinions or recommendations </p>
      
      <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
      <p>-Whenever I feel stuck on some concepts or didnt understand something I will always gonna seek help with our facilitator</p>
      
      
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>-Facilitators are very approachable and can answer every questions that you ask related to programming and things in Dev Academy.</p>
      
      <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
      <p>-not that i know of because I prepared myself to take all my time for this bootcamp</p>
