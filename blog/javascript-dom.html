    <h1>Welcome to Javascript Fundamentals</h1>
    <p>
      Javascript is a high level language like Java,C++, Python, etc. It has the
      same work flow and programming logic but different syntax from the other
      languages.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      It is easier to use Javascript among the others in terms of defining a
      variable because in Javascript we only use 3 variable identifier keywords
      which are <strong>var, let and const </strong>compared to other
      programming language like C++,Java or C, you need to define it in
      different terms like <strong>int</strong> for integer,<strong
        >float</strong
      >
      for floating numbers or numbers with decimal values,
      <strong>char</strong> for character values and many more. However, those 3
      languages are good on their own when it comes on developing systems
    </p>
    <h1>Defining Variables</h1>
    <p>
      Defining variables in Javascript is easier using
      <strong>let,var, const</strong> but this three have different purposes on
      declaring values.
    </p>
    <br />
    <ul class="list">
      <li>
        <strong>var keyword</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            are function-scoped or globally scoped, depending on where they are
            declared.
          </li>
          <li>
            This means they are accessible throughout the entire function or in
            the global scope if declared outside of any function.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>let keyword</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          are block-scoped. They are only accessible within the block (enclosed
          by curly braces) in which they are defined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Block scope includes loops, conditional statements, and any other code
          blocks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>const keyword</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>are intended to hold constant or immutable values.</li>
        <li>
          Once you assign a value to a const variable, you cannot reassign it to
          a different value.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h1>Analogy</h1>
    <p>
      On my previous reflection about html and css, <strong>HTML</strong> is
      like the skeleton of the website where you put what elements are needed in
      your page and <strong>CSS</strong> gives colors,size and design.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Javascript is the one that gives functionality on those elements.
      Manipulate those elements, for example if you clicked a button, you want
      to use javascript to give functionality to it.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h1>Control Flow</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Control Flow</strong> is a fundamental concept in programming that
      refers to the order in which statements and instructions are executed in a
      program. So basically, when we break down the word control and flow,
      control means you can control whatever instruction you tell to the
      computer and flow is like the flow of your instruction in order for the
      computer to understand what you are saying to it. So we have different
      ways to use control flow for the computer to understand what we wanna tell
      them. And those control flows are:
    </p>
    <br />
    <ul style="margin-left: 40vw; font-size: 2em">
      <li>Condition Statements</li>
      <li>Loops</li>
      <li>Function Calls</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Condition Statements</h1>
    <p>
      This work flow let you tell the computer to make a condition for example
      you wanna say "Hey computer I want you to translate the word Hello in
      different languages if the language is Filipino please say "Kamusta" else
      if the language is Chinese say "Ni hao" else if the language is Samoan say
      "Talofa" "
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      So in order for the computer to understand what you are trying to tell you
      need to execute a code like this:
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      <span class="if">if</span>(word=='Filipino') <br />
      <p>{</p>
      <br />
      <p>say('Kamusta')</p>
      <br />
      <p>}</p>
      <br />
      <p><span class="if">else if</span>(word=='Chinese')</p>
      <br />
      <p>{</p>
      <br />
      <p>say('Ni Hao')</p>
      <br />
      <p>}</p>
      <br />
      <p><span class="if">else if</span>(word=='Samoan'){</p>
      <br />
      <p>say('Talofa')</p>
      <br />
      <p>}</p>
    </p>

    <h1>Loops</h1>
    <p>
      This control flow makes the computer to loop around the instruction, I
      will discuss this further after. So basically if you want the computer to
      count from 1 to five, you might tell it this way "computer say 1, say 2,
      say 3, say 4, say 5". When you execute this in code:
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>say(1)</p>
    <p>say(2)</p>
    <p>say(3)</p>
    <p>say(4)</p>
    <p>say(5)</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      However what if you want the computer to count 1 to 100? or even a
      million? You dont really wanna waste your time typing each function from
      say(1) to say(1000000). So how are you going to do it?
    </p>
    <p>In that situation we will use a <strong>Loop:</strong></p>
    <br />
    <p style="text-align: center;">this image shows telling the computer to say 1 to 10</p>
    <div><img src="../image/loop.png" alt="loop image"></div>
    <p>to have a better understanding please look at the flowchart below to see how we simulate the loop</p>
    <div><img src="../image/loop flowchart.png" alt="loop image"></div>
    <p>On the flowchart, it shows how the statements loops around and the loop will end if the value of x is less than or equal to 10. So basically when value of x exceeds to 10 the loop will stop</p>
    <h1>DOM(Document Object Model)</h1>
    <div><img src="../image/DOM.png" style = "height:70vh;width:90vw"  alt="DOM"></div>
    <p>The DOM or Document Object Model, is a programming interface for web documents.</p>
    <br>
    <p> It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content dynamically.The DOM is a way for programs (typically written in JavaScript) to interact with web pages and make them dynamic and interactive.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>Array</h1>
    <p>Array is a collection of data under the variable name and data are stored in sequential order by index</p>
    <div><img src="../image/array.png" alt="loop image" style = "height:70vh;width:90vw"></div>
    <h1>Object</h1>
    <p>Object is also a collection of data under the variable name. It differs from array because an object hold each data in property and a value. In real life, object is like person and the properties of that person has name with the key of 'Anthony',age with the key of 30,address with the key of Masterton </p>
    <div><img src="../image/object.png" alt="loop image"></div>
    <h1>Functions</h1>
    <p>Functions is like an ingredients to your recipe. Your food wont be delicious without this ingredient.In programming, function is like a container of instructions. So after making this container of instruction,
      you can use it to make your program work. In real life, think about a motorbike. A motorbike wont work if it doesnt have wheels. So the motorbike is the structure of your program and the wheels are your function.
